#### Hypothesis: Insects as a solution to world hunger and food security

##### Premise
- Pressure on food systems (agriculture and meat production) due to growing world population
- Other constraints on food systems: climate change, land degradation, loss of biodiversity

##### Scope of the project
1. Food production as it is isn't sustainable. Can an insect-based diet help?
2. Environmental impact of an insect-based diet — quantified by 
3. Indigenous inset diets
4. Companies selling inset food products
5. Insect recipes?
6. Interactive — swapping x% meat with insect will help the environment y%

##### Excerpts from Edible Insects in Sustainable Food Systems
- While a global concern about the sustainable utilization of resources was born at the Rio Earth
Summit over 25 years ago, there have been few major renewals in food systems that
could bring hope for more sustainable food production up until now. The FAO publication ignited this hope by pointing out the overlooked potentials of insects. 
- What is a sustainable food system? A food system is considered sustainable when it delivers food security and nutrition for all in a way that economic, social and environmental sustainability is not compromised for future generations.
- Food system sustainability can be interpreted differently depending on cultural, economic and geographical context.

##### Data/reports available
1. [Emissions](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT)
2. [Agri emissions](https://www.wri.org/insights/everything-you-need-know-about-agricultural-emissions)
3. [Global greenhouse gas emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)
4. [The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World](https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2021/en/)

##### Data to look for
1. Number of edible insect species, where they're found and their environmental impact
2. Agricultural emissions projections
3. World hunger index projections
4. Rate of increase in meat consumption
5. Effect of meat production

##### Extra things to look into
[The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda)

##### Gameplan
1. Quantify world's food scarcity --- show need for more food. 
- Data: World hunger index?
2. How unsustainable food production currently is
- Data: emissions from meat production, emissions from agriculture
3. How can insects help?
- Number of edible species
- Nutrition information
- History of insect diets
4. Bonus: Inset recipes database
